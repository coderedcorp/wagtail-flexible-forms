Wagtail flexible forms
======================

Want a more flexible form builder than ``wagtail.contrib.forms``?

Want a better, more relevant interface?

This project is for you!

**Currently in alpha**, working but not documented nor tested yet,
will be merged into Wagtail in the end, as ``wagtail.contrib.stream_forms``.

Future of This Project
----------------------

This project was originally developed by Bertrand Bordage of NoriPyt.

The most stable version of this code is currently vendored in `coderedcms`. In 2021 CodeRed took ownership of this repository, and we plan to de-vendor the code from `coderedcms` and produce a stable, documented, and tested version of `wagtail-flexible-forms` as its own pip package. It is a fantastic package and we are excited to be investing in it to share with the Wagtail community. Stay tuned!
