Wagtail flexible forms
======================

Want a more flexible form builder than `wagtail.contrib.forms`?

Want a better, more relevant interface?

This project is for you!

**Currently in development**, working but not documented nor tested yet, will be merged into Wagtail in the end, as `wagtail.contrib.stream_forms`.


History & Future of This Project
--------------------------------

This project was [originally developed by Bertrand Bordage of NoriPyt](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/noripyt/wagtails-first-hatch).

In 2019, CodeRed vendored the code as part of Wagtail CRX (`coderedcms`) to provide maintenance and support as part of that package.

In 2021 CodeRed took ownership of this repository, and with renewed interest from the Wagtail community, in 2025 de-vendored the code from `coderedcms` and backported the past 6 years of changes to produce a stable version of `wagtail-flexible-forms` as its own pip package.

Stay tuned in 2025 as we work to add documentation, examples, and unit tests with the goal of eventually merging the package into Wagtail as the official "stream forms" implementation. It is a fantastic package and we are excited to be investing in it to share with the Wagtail community!
